# 🌿Plant-Health-Status-Predictor🌱🥀

## 🍃 Plant Health Status Predictor : A plant health detection model that provides image processing techniques to assess the well-being of plants.
* This model employs the K-means clustering algorithm to categorize plant images into three clusters:
  
      - 🌿 Healthy
      - 🥀 Unhealthy
      - 🌱 Medium Healthy

🔍To train and evaluate this model, A large collection of plant photos covering seedling through flowering and fruiting stages was gathered. 
📊✨Applying K-means clustering to these images creates a model, that can be can effectively determine the plant's health status, providing valuable insights for timely intervention and optimized care.🚀

* 50 Components were used to this model and Clustering Plot of first two principal components is below.🔆
